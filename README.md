# dhx [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dhx.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dhx) 

> Agile JS framework for realtime web apps

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install dhx --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('dhx');
```

If the plugin has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list the newly-installed plugin's task or tasks. In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.


## Options
### options.separator
Type: `String`
Default value: `',  '`

A string value that is used to do something with whatever.

### options.punctuation
Type: `String`
Default value: `'.'`

A string value that is used to do something else with whatever else.



## Usage Examples
### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used to do something with whatever. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result would be `Testing, 1 2 3.`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  dhx: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      'test/actual/': ['test/fixtures/*.js']
    }
  }
});
```

### Custom Options
In this example, custom options are used to do something else with whatever else. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result in this case would be `Testing: 1 2 3 !!!`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  dhx: {
    options: {
      separator: ': ',
      punctuation: ' !!!',
    },
    files: {
      'test/actual/': ['test/fixtures/*.js']
    }
  }
});
```


## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt][], and build the documentation with [grunt-readme](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-readme).
